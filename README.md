## Getting started

This project uses a MongoDB database, makes sure you have MongoDB installed and running.

More information on how to install MongoDB [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/server/install/).

First, clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cesco-f/HAUFE-TC-Rick-Morty.git
$ cd HAUFE-TC-Rick-Morty
```

From that folder run the following to install all the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm i
```

Create a ```.env```  in both server and client folders following the ```.env.example``` files inside the two folders.

## Running the app

Open one terminal and run the following:

```bash
$ cd server
$ npm run start
```
Open another terminal and run the following:

```bash
$ cd client
$ npm run start
```

The app is now available at ```http://localhost:3000```.
